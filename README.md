## How to Use The Simulator
The Simulator is a specialized character management application designed for avid Sims players who need to organize their extensive collections. Developed through user-centered design, this tool enables players to track family relationships, character traits, and neighborhood connectionsâ€”transforming what was previously a cumbersome spreadsheet task into an engaging digital experience. Users can easily create character profiles, visualize family trees, and organize neighborhoods through an intuitive interface that maintains the authentic Sims aesthetic. By providing an organizational system that feels like a natural extension of the game, The Simulator enhances the gameplay experience while solving a genuine pain point for dedicated players.

### Key Features
- Family Tree Visualization: Easily map relationships between Sims characters
- Character Profiles: Detailed information storage for each Sim
- Neighborhood Organization: Group families by neighborhood or world
- Trait Tracking: Keep track of each Sim's unique traits and characteristics
- Custom Categories: Create personalized organization systems
- Search Functionality: Quickly find specific Sims across multiple families
- Light/Dark Mode Support: Comfortable viewing in any environment

## Development Journey
This repository documents our process of building The Simulator following the Challenge Based Learning (CBL) framework. Our journey began with a mission to delight our user, which led us to discover her challenge of tracking Sims characters through cumbersome Excel spreadsheets. We progressed methodically from concept to implementation, creating low-fidelity sketches that established core functionality before advancing to more detailed wireframes. At each stage, we kept our user directly involved in the design process, gathering feedback that shaped everything from color choices to navigation patterns.

### Frameworks
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Core Data
- SF Symbols

#### Development Takeaways
- Collaborative workflows between team members enhanced overall product quality
- Modular design components improved reusability across multiple screens
- Systematic documentation of design specifications reduced decision fatigue during implementation
- User-centered design approach led to high satisfaction and adoption
- Implementing the 60-30-10 color rule helped maintain visual clarity despite a varied palette

## Design Philosophy
Our approach focused on understanding the complex relationships Sims players track across their gameplay experience. Through careful information architecture and thoughtful navigation patterns, we created a system that maintains the playful spirit of the original game while introducing intuitive organizational features. Each screen employs purposeful color theory and accessible design elements that enhance rather than interrupt the gaming experience.

#### Design Takeaways
- Balancing nostalgia with modern usability principles is crucial when designing for established franchises
- Creating a comprehensive style guide significantly streamlined the implementation process
- User testing at every stage prevented assumptions that could disconnect functionality from actual needs
- The high-fidelity prototype phase proved crucial to validating design decisions before implementation

## Roadmap
- [x] Character Profile Creation
- [x] Family Tree Visualization
- [x] Neighborhood Organization
- [ ] Integration with game save files
- [ ] Timeline feature to track generational changes
- [ ] Additional customization options
